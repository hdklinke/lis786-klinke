Watch out! Hoot Owl is hungry in an offbeat story with deadpan humor and bold, striking illustrations.

Hoot Owl is no ordinary owl. He is a master of disguise! In the blackness of night, he's preparing to swoop on his prey before it can realize his dastardly tricks. Look thereâ€”a tasty rabbit for him to eat! Hoot Owl readies his costume, disguising himself as . . . a carrot! Then he waits. The rabbit runs off. Never mind! Surely his next juicy target will cower against such a clever and dangerous creature as he! Kids will hoot at Sean Taylor's deliciously tongue-in-beak narration, belied by the brilliantly comical illustrations of Jean Jullien.
