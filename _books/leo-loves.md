This bright, cheerful look at a day in the life of a child of color will bring smiles to faces and laughs to little voices!

On Wednesdays, Leo and his mom go to Baby Time. There he plays peek-a-boo; sings the rolly song, the happy song, and the name song; plays with animals; and meets new friends.

The Baby Time activities featured in *Leo Loves Baby Time* will be familiar to children and parents and are presented in bright, vibrant colors that will draw the attention of the youngest readers.
