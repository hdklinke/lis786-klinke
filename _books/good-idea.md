*That Is Not a Good Idea!* is a hilarious, interactive picture book from bestselling author and illustrator Mo Willems, the creator of books like *Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus*, the *Knuffle Bunny* series, the *Elephant and Piggie* series, *Goldilocks and the Three Dinosaurs*, and many other new classics.

Inspired by the evil villains and innocent damsels of silent movies, Willems tells the tale of a hungry fox who invites a plump goose to dinner. As with the beloved Pigeon books, kids will be calling out the signature refrain and begging for repeated readings. The funny details in the full-color illustrations by three-time Caldecott Honoree Mo Willems will bring nonstop laughter to story time.
