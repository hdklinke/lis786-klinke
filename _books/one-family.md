Just how many things can "one" be?

One box of crayons.

One batch of cookies.

One world.

One family.

From veteran picture book author George Shannon and up-and-coming artist Blanca Gomez comes a playful, interactive book that shows how a family can be big or small and comprised of people of a range of genders and races.
